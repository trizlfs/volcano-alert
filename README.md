# [Volcano Interactive Mapping](https://volcano-alert.pages.dev/)

This is my open-source school project showing all actively monitored volcanos in the United States.
Features Include
- Interactive Map
- Volcano Details
- Government Icons (Showing Alert and Color Level)
- And more

  I recommend uploading to Cloudflare's pages.dev for easy hosting and sites.
